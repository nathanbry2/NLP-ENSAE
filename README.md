# NLP-ENSAE

This repository contains the project of Bertrand VUILLEMOT and Nathan BRY for the class **Machine Learning for NLP** at ENSAE. 

We conduct an analysis and trained a BERT model on a dataset containing about 28k tweets on financial topics (stocks, cryptos, etc). The Data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/davidwallach/financial-tweets)
