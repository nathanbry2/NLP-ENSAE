# NLP-ENSAE

This repository contains the project of Bertrand VUILLEMOT and Nathan BRY for the class **Machine Learning for NLP** at ENSAE. 

We conduct an analysis and trained a BERT model on a dataset containing about 28k tweets on financial topics (stocks, cryptos, etc). The Data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/davidwallach/financial-tweets).

The report describing the different steps of the project can be found in *NLP_ENSAE_Bry_Vuillemot.pdf*

The notebook containing the code (analysis + models) can be found in *NLP_project.ipynb*
